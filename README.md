## Project Overview

**Make Theme 2024** is a custom WordPress theme development project built using Docker for a streamlined and efficient development environment. This project leverages the [Lumora](https://github.com/austincumanan/lumora) starter theme to accelerate the theme development process, providing a solid foundation with best practices in place.

By utilizing Docker, all WordPress files are mapped to the local project directory, allowing easy access and modification through your preferred code editor, such as VS Code. Additionally, phpMyAdmin is integrated for convenient database management.

## Features

- **Dockerized Environment:** Simplifies setup and ensures consistency across different development machines.
- **Starter Theme Integration:** Built upon the Lumora starter theme for a robust foundation.
- **Live Reloading:** Immediate reflection of changes made to theme files.
- **phpMyAdmin Included:** Easy database management interface.
- **Version Control Ready:** Structured for Git-based version control and collaboration.
